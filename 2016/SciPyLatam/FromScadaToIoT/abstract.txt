This talk will describe a SCADA system build with Python with an home brew 
protocol called Mara for a power substation as part of a research and development project in UNPJSB of Trelew city.

We will describe some of the challenges faced during its development
and how they were overcome. Specially non functional requirements such as
reliability and low latency (MQTT, AMQP and STOMP).

Finally we will cover how we're iterating over its architecture to provide
a more suitable solution for IoT field and how we're using Python at 
lower levels PlatformIO and how we plan to integrate CIAA (Argentine 
Open Industrial Computer).
